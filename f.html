                          Not tryna be indie
                          Not tryna be cool
                          Just tryna be in this
                          Tell me, are you too?

                          Can you feel where the wind is?
                          Can you feel it through
                          All of the windows
                          Inside this room?

                          'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
                          And I wanna feel you too
                          I wanna see the sun rise
                          On your sins, just me and you
                          Light it up, on the run
                          Let's make love tonight
                          Make it up, fall in love
                          Try

                          (Baby, I'm right here)

                          But you'll never be alone
                          I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
                          I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
                          Baby, I'm right here
                          I'll hold you when things go wrong
                          I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
                          I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
                          Baby, I'm right here

                          I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
                          Baby, I'm right here

                          We were shut like a jacket
                          So do your zip
                          We would roll down the rapids
                          To find a wave that fits

                          Can you feel where the wind is?
                          Can you feel it through
                          All of the windows
                          Inside this room?

                          Light it up, on the run
                          Let's make love tonight
