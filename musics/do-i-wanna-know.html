                          Have you got colour in your cheeks?
                          Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
                          That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
                          Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                          Have you no idea that you're in deep?
                          I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
                          How many secrets can you keep?
                          'Cause there's this tune I found
                          That makes me think of you somehow
                          And I play it on repeat
                          Until I fall asleep
                          Spilling drinks on my settee

                          (Do I wanna know)
                          If this feeling flows both ways?
                          (Sad to see you go)
                          Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
                          (Baby, we both know)
                          That the nights were mainly made
                          For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

                          Crawling back to you
                          Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                          'Cause I always do
                          Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                          Now I've thought it through
                          Crawling back to you

                          So have you got the guts?
                          Been wondering if your heart's still open
                          And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
                          Simmer down and pucker up
                          I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
                          Of trying to kiss you
                          I don't know if you feel the same as I do
                          We could be together if you wanted to

                          (Do I wanna know)
                          If this feeling flows both ways?
                          (Sad to see you go)
                          Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
                          (Baby, we both know)
                          That the nights were mainly made
                          For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

                          Crawling back to you
                          Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                          'Cause I always do
                          Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                          Now I've thought it through
                          Crawling back to you

                          (Do I wanna know)
                          If this feeling flows both ways?

                          For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day

                          (Do I wanna know?)
                          Too busy being yours to fall
                          (Sad to see you go)
                          Ever thought of calling, darling?
                          (Do I wanna know?)
                          Do you want me crawling back to you?</font></pre>
