		New blood joins this earth
		And, quickly, he's subdued
		Through constant pained disgrace
		The young boy learns their rules

		With time, the child draws in
		This whipping boy done wrong
		Deprived of all his thoughts
		The young man struggles on and on, he's known
		A vow unto his own
		That never from this day
		His will they'll take away

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never be
		Never see
		Won't see what might have been

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never free
		Never me
		So I dub thee Unforgiven

		They dedicate their lives
		To running all of his
		He tries to please them all
		This bitter man he is

		Throughout his life the same
		He's battled constantly
		This fight he cannot win
		A tired man, they see no longer cares
		The old man then prepares
		To die regretfully
		That old man here is me

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never be
		Never see
		Won't see what might have been

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never free
		Never me
		So I dub thee Unforgiven

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never be
		Never see
		Won't see what might have been

		What I've felt
		What I've known
		Never shined through in what I've shown
		Never free
		Never me
		So I dub thee Unforgiven

		Never free
		Never me
		So I dub thee Unforgiven
		You labeled me
		I'll label you
		So I dub thee Unforgiven

		Never free
		Never me
		So I dub thee Unforgiven
		You labeled me
		I'll label you
		So I dub thee Unforgiven</font></pre>
