                          They know what is what
                          But they don't know what is what
                          They just strut
                          What the fuck?

                          [Katy Perry]
                          A tiger
                          Don't lose no sleep
                          Don't need opinions
                          From a shellfish or a sheep

                          Don't you come for me
                          No, not today
                          You're calculated
                          I got your number
                          'Cause you're a joker
                          And I'm a courtside killer queen
                          And you will kiss the ring
                          You best believe

                          [Katy Perry]
                          So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
                          For more than a minute, get used to it
                          Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
                          'Cause I stay winning
                          Lay 'em up like

                          [Katy Perry]
                          Swish, swish, bish
                          Another one in the basket
                          Can't touch this
                          Another one in the casket

                          [Katy Perry]
                          Your game is tired
                          You should retire
                          You're 'bout as cute as
                          An old coupon expired
                          And karma's not a liar
                          She keeps receipts

                          [Katy Perry]
                          So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around

                          (Let's go)

                          Swish, swish, bish
                          Another one in the basket

                          Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
                          Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
                          My life is a movie, I'm never off set
                          Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
                          Swish swish, aww I got them upset
                          But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
                          Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
                          'Cause I make M's, they get much less

                          Don't be tryna double back, I already despise you
                          All that fake love you showin' couldn't even disguise you

                          They know what is what
                          (Do they know?)
                          But they don't know what is what
