                          (One, one, one, one, one, one)

                          Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
                          (Out of my mind, out of my mind)
                          Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
                          (Too many times, too many times)

                          My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
                          Nobody else
                          But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself
                          I tell myself

                          One: Don't pick up the phone
                          You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
                          Two: Don't let him in
                          You'll have to kick him out again
                          Three: Don't be his friend
                          You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                          And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I gotta tell them to myself
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I gotta tell them to myself

                          I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
                          (No way to turn) no way
                          (No way to turn) no
                          Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
                          (I never learn, I never learn)
                          But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself
                          I tell myself
                          I do, I do, I do

                          One: Don't pick up the phone
                          You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
                          Two: Don't let him in
                          You'll have to kick him out again
                          Three: Don't be his friend
                          You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                          And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I gotta tell them to myself
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I gotta tell them to myself

                          Practice makes perfect
                          I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
                          (I got new rules, I count 'em)
                          Eat, sleep and breathe it
                          Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
                          (I got new, I got new, I got new)

                          One: Don't pick up the phone
                          You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
                          Two: Don't let him in
                          You'll have to kick him out again
                          Three: Don't be his friend
                          You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                          And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          I gotta tell them to myself
                          I got new rules, I count 'em
                          (Baby, you know I count 'em)
                          I gotta tell them to myself

                          Don't let him in, don't let him in
                          Don't, don't, don't, don't
                          Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
                          Don't, don't, don't, don't
                          Don't let him in, don't let him in
                          Don't, don't, don't, don't
                          Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
                          Don't, don't, don't
                          You gettin' over him</font></pre>
