		I'm a puppet on a string
		Tracy island, time-traveling diamond
		Cutter shaped heartaches

		That comes to find you
		For in some velvet morning
		Years too late
		She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
		Through an open space
		In my mind, when she's not right there beside me

		I go crazy, cause here isn't where I wanna be
		And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
		And I can't help myself
		All I wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
		Well, are you mine?
		Are you mine?
		Are you mine? Alright

		I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
		Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
		Unfair we're not somewhere
		Misbehaving for days
		Great escape, lost track of time and space
		She's a silver lining, climbing on my desire

		And I go crazy, cause here isn't where I wanna be
		And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
		And I can't help myself
		All I wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
		Well, are you mine?
		Are you mine tomorrow?
		Are you mine? Or just mine tonight?
		Are you mine? Are you mine?

		And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
		So in case I'm mistaken
		I just wanna hear you say
		You got me, baby
		Are you mine?

		She's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
		Through an open space
		In my mind when she's not right there beside me

		I go crazy, cause here isn't where I wanna be
		And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
		And I can't help myself
		All I wanna hear her say is: Are you mine?
		Well, are you mine?
		Are you mine tomorrow?
		Are you mine? Or just mine tonight?
		Are you mine?
		Are you mine tomorrow?
		Or just mine tonight?</font></pre>
