                          All I am is a man
                          I want the world in my hands
                          I hate the beach
                          But I stand
                          In California with my toes in the sand
                          Use the sleeves of my sweater
                          Let's have an adventure
                          Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
                          Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
                          You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

                          She knows what I think about
                          And what I think about
                          One love, two mouths
                          One love, one house
                          No shirt, no blouse
                          Just us, you find out
                          Nothing that I really wanna tell you about, no

                          'Cause it's too cold
                          For you here and now
                          So let me hold
                          Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

                          And if I may just take your breath away
                          I don't mind if there's not much to say
                          Sometimes the silence guides our minds
                          So move to a place so far away
                          The goosebumps start to raise
                          The minute that my left hand meets your waist
                          And then I watch your face
                          Put my finger on your tongue
                          'Cause you love to taste, yeah

                          These hearts adore
                          Everyone the other beats hardest for
                          Inside this place is warm
                          Outside it starts to pour

                          Coming down
                          One love, two mouths
                          One love, one house
                          No shirt, no blouse
                          Just us, you find out
                          Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no

                          'Cause it's too cold
                          For you here and now
                          So let me hold
                          Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                          'Cause it's too cold
                          For you here and now
                          So let me hold
                          Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

                          Whoa, whoa
                          Whoa, whoa, whoa
                          Whoa, whoa

                          'Cause it's too cold
                          For you here and now
                          So let me hold
                          Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

                          It's too cold
                          For you here and now
                          Let me hold
                          Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

                          It's too cold
                          It's too cold
                          The holes of my sweater</font></pre>
